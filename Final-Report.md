# Final Report

## Introduction 
* Tell us the problem you are addressing:
	* The problem I am addressing is the ambiguity of temporal requirements in software engineering, and how they are important, as well as generating test cases for them
* Why is the problem important?
	* Temporal Software Requirements are very key in the field of not only Requirements Engineering but also in Software Engineering. Temporal Requirements are usually the most important from a schedule standpoint in the development process

* __Research Questions__
	1. aaa
	2. bbb
	3. ccc

## Motivation 
* Tell us the motivation of your approach/study:
	* I chose to pick this topic because it is very relevant in the field of Requirements Engineering, a field of Computer Science I discovered this year and found very interesting
* Limitations of existing work
	* Existing work is inconclusive if there is actually a good way of determining temporal logic or not. There has been 1 paper about creating test cases through temporal logic, however it was a research paper with no public repository of code. I wanted to see if I could imitate their results
	
## Background  
* Technical background needed to understand your approach:
	* A background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), knowledge of text classifiers, machine learning as well as terminology used in the field of Requirements Engineering
	* In the initial stages of development, I was using the Jupyter notebook alongside Python to create a classifier. Jupyter was new to me.
	* In my final approach to attempting to solve the problem, I used a software called "Node-RED." It did a lot of the work for me, however it required a switch-up in which programming language I used, shifiting from Python to JavaScript
	* It would be helpful to know what Node-RED is before looking at my actual implementation. I will briefly explain Node-RED before going into the demo.
	* From a technological standpoint, to emulate my project, one needs a background in either Python or JavaScript. Initially I was going to use Python, but instead opted to use JavaScript.
	* Other background needed would be: the knowledge of Part of Speech tagging (POS tagging) and its correlation to Temporal Requirements, knowing what a test case is, and how to generate a test case based off of a requirement, temporal or non-temporal
	
## Approach 
* Overview, detailed technical stuff, examples, implementation
	* aaa
	
## Results
* Results and analysis of the results
	* The scale of the project is no where close to where I wanted it to be. Instead of having an ML solution, I had to create a makeshift application to try and display what I wanted to convey. However I believe I have laid good groundwork in an area that previously did not much physical work into itself.

* Insights and take-home messages
	* The largest takeaway was to pick your battles and don’t jump around from idea to idea too much in a short term development process.
	
## Limitations 
* Technical limitations 
	* Technical limitations were large, in the fact that this is still a theoretical topic without much documentation to back it up. I wanted to have a challenge. I lacked the proper background knowledge going into the project.
* What you should have done if you had more time
	* If I had more time (perhaps another semester), I would have liked to be able to test out other software or read other papers. Most importantly, I would want to have a trained classifier
	
## Discussion 
* Future work
	* If I were to continue this in the future, I would still like to try to use Node-RED, as it is a very friendly tool as well as supporting npm packages with documentation as to how to create and train a classifier, which would therefore allow for scalability in the project. After all, a few weeks messing with Pandas, and I should have a good grasp on it. I simply ran out of time to find a proper solution. However perhaps that is not the best method of going about this. I could also create a classifier in Python that could just as easily do the trick.

* What have you learned from the project?
* As I said before: __The largest takeaway was to pick your battles and don’t jump around from idea to idea too much in a short term development process.__
	* I was never really given a foothold or a good place to start. I hit a lot of dead ends. This has happened in industry to myself and colleagues working in R&D projects.
	* However, through this project, I have learned a lot about different software tools in ML.
	* The intertwining of NLP and ML cannot be understressed.Without ML, there wouldn't be NLP. ML is the true workhorse of the modern computing age. 
	
## Demo 
* How my implementation works:
	* First of all, Node-RED is ...

* __Ideally, a UI like the below was the ultimate goal__
