# Final Report

## Introduction 
* Tell us the problem you are addressing:
	* The problem I am addressing is the ambiguity of temporal requirements in software engineering, and how they are important, as well as generating test cases for them
* Why is the problem important?
	* Temporal Software Requirements are very key in the field of not only Requirements Engineering but also in Software Engineering. Temporal Requirements are usually the most important from a schedule standpoint in the development process

* __Research Questions__

## Motivation 
* Tell us the motivation of your approach/study:
	* I chose to pick this topic because it is very relevant in the field of Requirements Engineering, a field of Computer Science I discovered this year and found very interesting
* Limitations of existing work
	* Existing work is inconclusive if there is actually a good way of determining temporal logic or not. There has been 1 paper about creating test cases through temporal logic, however it was a research paper with no public repository of code. I wanted to see if I could imitate their results
	
## Background  
* Technical background needed to understand your approach:
	* A background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), knowledge of text classifiers, machine learning as well as terminology used in the field of Requirements Engineering
	* In the initial stages of development, I was using the Jupyter notebook alongside Python to create a classifier. Jupyter was new to me.
	* In my final approach to attempting to solve the problem, I used a software called "Node-RED." It did a lot of the work for me, however it required a switch-up in which programming language I used, shifiting from Python to JavaScript
	* It would be helpful to know what Node-RED is before looking at my actual implementation
	* Other background needed would be: the knowledge of Part of Speech tagging (POS tagging) and its correlation to Temporal Requirements, knowing what a test case is, and how to generate a test case based off of a requirement, temporal or non-temporal
