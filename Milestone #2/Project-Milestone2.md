### 1. Give a name, description and necessary information for each test case

This is a good practice which allows you to verify right away what a specific test case is about. It makes it easier for testers who did not participate in designing the test cases to find their way in the scenario, and also for those who e.g. created the script but postponed it to work on another project. Each case should contain a short but understandable description of all the information that makes it possible to answer the question “What do I want to test?”, determine the assumptions and preconditions necessary to perform the test, and add the necessary test data to perform it.

### 2. Write cases for the end-user

When building a test scenario, put yourself in the end-user’s shoes. A good test scenario covers as many paths as possible through which a potential user in the application will go. So it is important to contact the client a lot to get the best possible understanding of the product concept, as well as to ensure the best possible impression when the application is used by the client and the end-user.

### 3. Grouping of test cases

Test scenarios are often built in spreadsheets. As there appear more and more test cases in the scenario, it can be problematic to find all the relevant info in the spreadsheet. Currently, there are many tools out there to manage test scenarios more efficiently, such as thought mapping software. After the scenario is finished, it is necessary to analyze exactly what we have managed to create. You need to think about whether the scenario is good enough, whether it allows you to verify the design requirements, if the cases are easy to understand and execute by the tester, and if they can be reused.

### 4. Universality of test cases

In next (new) projects, we can use some of the test cases from the scenarios that were created earlier in past projects. Often times, when writing a scenario, we can also use part of a test case that has already been written in a scenario for a completely different test case.

Given that the number of test cases is increasing with each new functionality and due to time and budget constraints, it is a huge challenge to create a universal test scenario that will ensure 100% test coverage of application areas. Efficient preparation of test scenarios is a skill that can only be acquired through practice. If you put yourself in the end-user’s shoes when creating test scenarios, you are on the right track. You may also want to prioritize the cases.

To do this, it is necessary to analyze the functionalities in the system and define which of them are crucial. Prioritized testing will significantly reduce the effort devoted to regressive tests that are performed to verify whether changes in software have caused errors, and whether the quality of the developed solutions will make users want to use the product testing.
